#+title: Parendeck 2D Engine
#+startup: hidestars

A rebirth of Holodeck 2D idea from my teenage years, except this time it's not C++ but Lisp :).

This time the architecture is... incremental, i.e. I'll be throwing
code at the pile until some structure manifests itself, and then
refactor accordingly.

* Games currently using the engine
