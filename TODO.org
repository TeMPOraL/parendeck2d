* Things to do
** Functionality
*** Logging
**** DONE Get the logger to register and log down all conditions.
**** DONE Get the logger to flush the file ASAP, so that we won't loose data in case of a crash.
**** DONE Get the logger to log a backtrace in case of a fatal error.

*** Configuration
    Something to read configs from an external source.
    Also that would make games avoid writing over global engine variables so much.

*** Asset management
    Needs to work with both bundled games and ones run interactively from sources.

*** ECS
    We'll be implementing an entity/component/system architecture for managing the game.

*** Test scene (default-game)

**** TODO Make it display engine name

**** TODO Make it display engine logo

***** TODO Make a logo

**** TODO Add an FPS counter

*** UI Overlays
**** TODO FPS counter overlay

**** TODO FPS graph overlay

**** TODO (Maybe) Keyboard/Mouse events overlay
     (showing last few events that happened)

** Utilities
*** TODO Color wrapper
    Something to make using colors better / more convenient.

*** DONE Basic OpenGL shapes in a nicer interface (point-and-draw)
    Things like: box, square, circles, regular polygons, etc.

*** TODO Basic collision detection utilities

**** TODO Box-box intersection
**** TODO Box-sphere intersection
